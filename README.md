#Hangman Game
The game is played as follows: a random word is chosen by the computer and the player needs to guess the letters in the word, one by one.   
With every wrong guess, the player loses a life and a part of the hangman is drawn. When drawing is complete, the game is lost. 
Guessing the word in time will be a win.
